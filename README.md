Ingame FMScout/FMAssistant (links [here](https://www.fmscout.com/a-ingame_fmscout09.html), [here](https://www.fmscout.com/i-797-FM-Assistant10.html), and [here](https://www.fmscout.com/i-1064-FM-Assistant-11.html)) were a series of real-time scouting and editing utility for Sports Interactive's Football Manager 2009, 2010 and 2011 (helper plus *cheating* utility), built on C# and .NET via Windows Forms (early versions) and WPF. This personal project allowed users to query the current game database by accessing ingame data (during runtime) to display and edit certain information about different game entities such as players, staff and teams.

This is, obviously, a dead project now. Nevertheless, I am releasing its code here for public use. Note that even though I have tested it and compiles/runs properly on VS 2017, I am making available **ONLY** the GUI interface and not the runtime engine, as it included memory offsets and other similar data.
